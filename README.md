# Root-Force-Solver
This is an analytic equation solver used to calcultate roots (real and complex) of general polynomials of upto 4th degree with REAL co-efficients, using algebraic methods. This program uses self-built functions to evalute roots. The functions use the established Cardano's method for cubic equations, Ferrari's method to solve quartic equations. It obviously uses quadratic formula too. 
Features:
1) Solves polynomial equations from Degree 1 (linear) to Degree 4 (quartic).
2) Implements the classic Cardano's Method for cubics.
3) Implements the legendary Ferrari's Method (with a Resolvent Cubic) for quartics.
4) Handles the bi-quadratic case in quartics using quadratic formula, to reduce complexity.
